Outgrow is a growth marketing platform that enables marketers to build interactive content and tools to increase customer engagement and boost demand generation with no custom design or development. In an interview, Oratham said that his company became the largest polling technology company in the world with over 4000 publications with clients like The New York Times and The Guardian. He started the company because when he was working as a developer, many of his clients who did not have a good experience with outsourcing came to him to correct their mistakes. While working for these clients, he realized that there was a lack of major information asymmetry in the industry because of this the clients met the wrong developers. He started working on providing a trusted network of vetted developers and transparent portfolios up front to help companies choose the right developer.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Neta_App\"><\/span><strong>Neta App<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Pratham developed the Neta App in 2018. The app allows voters to rate their elected representatives at the State and Central level. The app allows the public to vote for the political leaders in power and it works as a feedback mechanism for political leaders. The app is available on Android and iOS platforms. The idea of this app was noted during the February 2018 by-polls in Rajasthan\u2019s Ajmer and Alwar constituencies. It was also used in the May 2018 Assembly elections in Karnataka. According to him, he started the app because he did not like the politicos in India. He thought that leaders do not respond to the public after being elected. He thought that the situation could improve if the politicians were rated\u00a0just like Uber drivers and restaurants. In an interview, he talked about the app and said,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Unlike with [food aggregator] Zomato, we think, politicians don\u2019t really care about their grade. What they care about is the number of votes they have received. So we are following that model now. Voting is representative of the rating the politician will get. The company, however, is planning to launch another tool that allows users to show their approval of the government. That is on a five-point scale, as a poll.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_159270\" style=\"width: 377px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wikibio.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Pratham-Mittals-Neta-app.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-159270\" class=\" wp-image-159270\" src=\"https:\/\/wikibio.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Pratham-Mittals-Neta-app.jpg\" alt=\"Pratham Mittal's Neta app\" width=\"367\" height=\"552\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wikibio.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Pratham-Mittals-Neta-app.jpg 800w, https:\/\/wikibio.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Pratham-Mittals-Neta-app-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/wikibio.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Pratham-Mittals-Neta-app-681x1024.jpg 681w, https:\/\/wikibio.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Pratham-Mittals-Neta-app-768x1155.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-159270\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pratham Mittal&#8217;s Neta app<\/p><\/div><\/blockquote>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Masters_Union\"><\/span><strong>Master&#8217;s Union<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In August 2020, he founded Master&#8217;s Union, a business school in Gurugram.
