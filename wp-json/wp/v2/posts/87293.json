The film showcased the story of 5 close friends who are in college, experiencing different relationships, and learning new values. The film was released on 10 January 2014 under the banner of T-Series Super Cassettes Industries. Nicole Faria played the role of Jia, a young and extremely hot college girl, opposite <a href=\"https:\/\/wikibio.in\/himansh-kohli\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Himansh Kohli<\/a>. Nicole broke the stereotype of choosing to play a decent lead actress and instead she opted to play the character no one believed she will ever do. During the promotions of the film, the media question her choice of role, to which she replied,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I do not believe in fitting into stereotypes. I would like to be recognized for my personality and my acting capability. Looks are a bonus. I feel comfortable with my body and I do not believe I flaunt it.

She had taken French in school, and so it was tough for her to speak Hindi, but Divya and her team helped Nicole Faria with her Hindi. Although, the film did not performed well at the box office and mainly received negative reviews from the critics but the songs from the film proved to be huge hits.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Nicole Faria hot in Yaariyan\" width=\"1060\" height=\"596\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/QgJv2G-VuCU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Next in 2015, Nicole Faria featured in Nikkhil Advani produced and directed romantic comedy film &#8220;Katti Batti.&#8221; The lead cast of the film included Imran Khan, <a href=\"https:\/\/wikibio.in\/kangana-ranaut\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kangana Ranaut<\/a>, Vivan Bhatena, Mithila Palkar, Suparna Marwah, and Nicole Faria.
